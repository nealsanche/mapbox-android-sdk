##Getting started with the Mapbox Android SDK

This guide will take you through the process of adding a map to your Android app. It assumes you have a Java IDE (like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA) with the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) installed, and an app project open.

###Adding the SDK to your project

Clone the repository into your system and import build.gradle in the app project.

### Required Permissions

Ensure the following *core* permissions are requested in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

If your project needs to access location services, it'll also need the following permissions too:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
```

###The MapView
The ```MapView``` class is the key component of our library. It behaves like any other ```ViewGroup``` and its behavior can be changed statically with an [XML layout](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout.html) file, or programmatically during runtime.

#### XML layout
To add the ```MapView``` as a layout element, add the following to your xml file:
```xml
<com.mapbox.mapboxsdk.views.MapView
android:id="@+id/mapview"
android:layout_width="fill_parent"
android:layout_height="fill_parent"
mapbox:mapid="Your MapBox mapid" />
```


And then you can call it programmatically with

```java
this.findViewById(R.id.mapview);
```

#### On runtime

On runtime you can create a new MapView by specifying the context of the application and a valid [MapBox mapid](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api-overview/), a TileJSON file or a zxy image template.

```java
MapView mapView = new MapView(this, "examples.map-vyofok3q");
```

And set it as the current view like this:
```java	
this.setContentView(mapView);
```

### Overlays

Anything visual that is displayed over the map, maintaining its geographical position, we call it an ```Overlay```. To access a MapView's overlays at any point during runtime, use:

```java
mapView.getOverlays();
```

#### Markers

Adding a marker with the default styling is as simple as calling this for every marker you want to add:

```java
Marker marker = new Marker(mapView, title, description, LatLng)
mapView.addMarker(marker);
```

#### Location overlay

The location of the user can be displayed on the view using ```UserLocationOverlay```
```java
UserLocationOverlay myLocationOverlay = new UserLocationOverlay(this, mapView);
userLocationOverlay.enableMyLocation();
userLocationOverlay.setDrawAccuracyEnabled(true);
mapView.getOverlays().add(userLocationOverlay);
```

####Paths

Paths are treated as any other ```Overlay```, and are drawn like this:
```java
PathOverlay line = new PathOverlay(Color.RED, this);
line.addPoint(new GeoPoint(51.2, 0.1));
line.addPoint(new GeoPoint(51.7, 0.3));
mapView.getOverlays().add(line);
```

####Drawing anything into the map
To add anything with a higher degree of  customization you can declare your own ```Overlay``` subclass and define what to draw by overriding the ```draw``` method. It will give you a Canvas object for you to add anything to it:

```java
class AnyOverlay extends Overlay{
    @Override
    protected void draw(Canvas canvas, MapView mapView, boolean shadow) {		
        //do anything with the Canvas object
    }
}
```

### Switching layers *(experimental)*
We're making switchable layers as simple as possible in the SDK. You can try toggling between several maps (identified by a valid MapBox ID, a TileJSON file or a zxy image template) using the switchToLayer method

```java
mapView.switchToLayer("examples.map-vyofok3q");
```

### Screen rotation
By default, every time the screen is rotated, Android will call ```onCreate``` and return all states in the app to their inital values. This includes current zoom level and position of the MapView. The simplest way to avoid this is adding this line to your ```AndroidManifest.xml```, inside ```<activity>```:

	android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|uiMode"

Alternatively you can override the methods ```onSaveInstanceState()``` and ```onRestoreInstanceState()``` to have broader control of the saved states in the app. See this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4096169/onsaveinstancestate-and-onrestoreinstancestate) for more information on these methods

### Including SDK JavaDoc

JavaDocs are automatically generated and distributed with each official and SNAPSHOT release.  They can be downloaded from Maven Central for local viewing and / or integration with an IDE.  The latest official version is available here:

**`0.2.3` Release Overview**

http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.mapbox.mapboxsdk%7Cmapbox-android-sdk%7C0.2.3%7Cjar

**`0.2.3` JavaDoc**

http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/mapbox/mapboxsdk/mapbox-android-sdk/0.2.3/mapbox-android-sdk-0.2.3-javadoc.jar

### Generating SDK Documentation (aka JavaDoc)

```
cd <PROJECT_HOME>/MapboxAndroidSDK/
../gradlew clean assembleRelease generatereleaseJavadoc
cd build/docs/javadoc
open index.html
```
