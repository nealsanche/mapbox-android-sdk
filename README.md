# Mapbox Android SDK

An open source alternative for native maps on Android. This library lets
you use [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/), [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/),
and other tile sources in your app, as well as overlays like [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)
data and interactive tooltips.

This is a fork of [osmdroid](http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/), so the entire
core is open source: it doesn't depend on the Google Maps SDK or any components
outside of AOSP that would require the Play Store.

## Installation

We recommend using the Android SDK with [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/):
this will automatically install the necessary dependencies and pull the SDK
source code from the central Maven repository.

### With Gradle (Android Studio, IntelliJ, etc)

Add this to your to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots'}
}

dependencies {
    compile ('com.mapbox.mapboxsdk:mapbox-android-sdk:0.2.3-SNAPSHOT@aar'){
        transitive=true
    }
}
```

### Manually / Hardcoding In Project

Download and include the mapbox-android-sdk.aar file and all
artifacts (.aar and .jar files listed) listed in `MapboxAndroidSDK / build.gradle`.
These **will** change over time so please check back regularly.

*Example:*

* Mapbox Android SDK (.aar) - 0.2.3-SNAPSHOT
* Android Support V4 - 19.1
* OkHttp - 1.3.0
* NineOldAndroids - 2.4.0
* DiskLRUCache - 2.0.1
* Guava - 16.0.1

### Building From Source

Building from source means you get the very latest version of our code.
The first step is to clone the repository to a directory in your system

    git clone https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-android-sdk.git

We use Gradle as a configuration and build tool: to use it with your IDE,
import the project by selecting `build.gradle` in the project root directory
as the project file.

Don't worry about installing Gradle on your system if you don't already have
it:  the project makes use of Gradle Wrapper, so a correct & current project
version of Gradle will automatically be installed and used to run the builds.
To use the Gradle wrapper just look for `gradlew`  or `gradlew.bat` (Windows)
in the project's main directory.  For example:

    cd <PROJECT_ROOT>
     ./gradlew --version

which will produce something like:

```

Gradle 1.10

```

See the [Gradle Wrapper documentation for more details](http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html).

Then you can build an archive:

```sh
./gradlew clean assembleRelease

# The archive (mapbox-android-sdk-<VERSION>.aar) will be found in
<PROJECTHOME>/MapboxAndroidSDK/build/libs
```

**Don't forget to then also include the dependencies from `MapboxAndroidSDK / build.gradle` in your classpath!**
